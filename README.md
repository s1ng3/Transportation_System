# transportation_System_Project
I created a ticket generator application in C for various transport modes like cars, planes, and boats. It's user-friendly, allowing easy ticket customization with details such as passenger info and travel specifics. The application is efficient, secure, and adaptable, making it suitable for different transportation ticketing requirements.
